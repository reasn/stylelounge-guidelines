## Guidelines @ StyleLounge

This document outlines guidelines we've agreed on at StyleLounge to keep the software we write maintainable, consistent and anti-fragile.

### Basics

* Think thoroughly about what you do.
* Understanding &gt; speed
* Think about efficiency, donâ€™t get lost in unimportant details
* Look for ready-to-use solutions
  * But understand them before adding them
  * Keep an eye on latest updates / stability
* Talk to team members before spending too much time on one problem
* Solve one problem at a time
* Think problems through in a structured way before you involve others
* Ask frequently for help and be pushy if you're stuck!
